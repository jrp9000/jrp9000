- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrp9000
- 👀 I’m interested in machinery and processes, especially scientific instruments and experiments, industrial tools and technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and mathematics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that goes to, or attempts to go to outer space. If it's military then I'll need a solid ethical reason to participate.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
